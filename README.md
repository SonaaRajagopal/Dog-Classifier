# Image-Classification-for-a-City-Dog-Show

The city is hosting a citywide dog show and I have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration.
Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog.
The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.
Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.
I need to use a Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

This code also does a comparioson between:

1. AlexNet

2. ResNet

3. VGG

model architectures to identify which architecture best works for image classification of this datasaet
